# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 19, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp.org challenges HTML / CSS

**Thoughts:** It is 8/11/17 and I forgot to create the log. I'm using my posts in Twitter and Facebook to record my progress here. I'm a little bummed because I feel like this log / journal is a great idea and is really helpful if done properly. I remember being really excited about starting the challenge

### Day 5: July 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've started a Tribute page for Selena

**Thoughts** I feel a bit unprepared to start a project like this one. I remember the challenges but I don't know where to start! I'm using code from other Codepen pages as a template

### Day 7: August 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Portfolio codepen has been started! 

**Thoughts** Again, I'm researching other ports in codepen for ideas and for how they start their code in the HTML pen. I want this to be perfect and I fear I will spend way more time than I should on it.

### Day 8: August 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: HTML Fundementals with CodeCademy

**Thoughts** I've been overwhelmed with the idea of the portfolio and am a bit frustrated, hense the week long gap!!! I did spend time researching but not much time coding during that week. I'm going through FreeCodeCamp material to review but it's not sticking so I started with CodeCademy and I love it!!!

### Day 9: August 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: HTML Content w/Codecademy

**Thoughts** I'm loving this learning platform. It's much easier to retain what I'm learning. Headings, paragraphs, links and pictures

**Link(s) to work**:  N/A


### Day 10: August 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: CSS fundementals

**Thoughts** Turning pictures into hyperlinks, commenting. I like how I am required to type line by line before the system will allow me to move on to the next step of the challenge.

### Day 11: August 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: CSS Fundementals

**Thoughts** This was mostly a review for me. I am stuck in "research" mode and I don't make a ton of progress ACTUALLY coding :( It's hard for me to continue if I feel like I do not have a whole-picture understanding of what I'm coding. Need to get over it and just practice the lines of code. I do love Codecademy.

### Day 12: August 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: CSS Structure and syntax AND completed 5 tasks from the Udemy course: Web Developer Bootcamp

**Thoughts** CSS makes sense and is still revie for me. I think I'm afraid of powering through material and forgetting what I learned. I'm taking notes in Google docs to use as a reference for when I'm working on projects. I'm SO excited to start coding with the new boot camp I signed up for. The first few tasks are orientation.

**Thoughts** I.LOVE.IT --- I've getting oriented and didn't get through to where I started writing code yet. I had 30 min today.

### Day 14: August 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Lectures 11-15 - Modzilla Developer Network

### Day 15: August 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Lectures 16-20 - Lists, bold, italicized text

**Thoughts**: Did my first official assignment in the course! Because it was mostly review for me, I completed it in about 3-4 minutes. The hotkeys helped as well!
